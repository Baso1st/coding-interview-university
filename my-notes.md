## Pick One Language for the Interview

#### Know thy common operations

Make sure you have at least the following operations down pat:

1. Initializing and using hash-backed maps (**dictionaries**) and sets
2. Performing **queue** and **stack** operations (whether using an array, like with Ruby’s pop/shift, or an explicit standard library implementation like Java’s Stack and [Linked List-backed Queue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4626812/how-do-i-instantiate-a-queue-object-in-java) classes)
3. **Defining classes** with **constructors** and **attributes**, **static** and **instance methods,** and defining a **subclass** and **interface**
4. **Throwing exceptions** for (1) **invalid input** and (2) **custom messages**
5. **Iterating** through **arrays and dictionaries** (both key and values)—including iterating while **maintaining an index** (Ruby’s each_with_index, [Python’s enumerate](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/522563/accessing-the-index-in-python-for-loops))
6. **Casting** between strings and integers
7. **Strings**: get character at index, get range, concatenate
8. Initializing **2d arrays**
9. Arithmetic: modulus (remainder), division (if the first operand is an integer, will it round the result to an integer?), **rounding** (ceiling and floor)
10. (*Bonus*) Switch statements
11. (*Bonus*) Built-in language sorting. Quickly defining a comparator to sort an array.
12. (*More advanced candidates*) The 5 standard **bit manipulation** operations (L/R shifts, not, or, and, xor)
